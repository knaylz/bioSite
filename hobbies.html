                    <p>I started the inverview by making sure the area was clean and had a comfortable ambience. Next
                    I asked if she wanted anything to drink, and she asked for water. I then borrowed something I
                    learned in a UX course, which is to let the interviewee know there are no wrong answers. Then, to
                    get a better understanding of my mom and her hobbies I first sat down with her and explained
                    this project to ensure she is on board and interested in sharing information about herself in this
                    way. Once she agreed I asked her the interview questions and gave her plenty of time to think of
                    her answers and elaborate if needed. The areas where I lacked the most information are the ones
                    we focused on more in depth. I asked for more details about her race horse training career, because
                    it took place before I was born. I listened for indications that she was happy about her answers and
                    the hobbies and memories she was sharing, and she always showed positive signs, which kept me
                    going. I also tried to see what parts of her interview answers she seemed most proud of, and what
                    ended up surprising me was that she is extremely proud of her kitchen remodeling project. She has
                    a strong interest in decorating, although that was not one of the answers to her question. I asked
                    if it were something she would consider to be a growing hobby, and she said yes. That is when she
                    said sheâ€™d like to remodel the living room, too. I think the home remodeling is something she would
                    like more people to know about, in addition to her horse training career.</p>
